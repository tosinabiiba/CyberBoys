# Here is a sample Python script that creates a recipe based on items in a fridge stored in a database:
import random
import mysql.connector

# Connect to the database
db = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='user',
    password='password',
    database='recipes'
)

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
cursor = db.cursor()

# Query the database for the ingredients in the fridge
query = 'SELECT ingredient FROM fridge'
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch the results of the query
ingredients = cursor.fetchall()

# The list of possible recipes
recipes = []

# Find all the recipes that can be made with the ingredients in the fridge
for ingredient in ingredients:
    # Query the database for recipes that include the current ingredient
    query = f'SELECT recipe FROM recipe_book WHERE ingredients LIKE "%{ingredient[0]}%"'
    cursor.execute(query)
    # Fetch the results of the query
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    # Add the recipes to the list of possible recipes
    recipes.extend(results)

# Print the list of recipes
print(f'Recipes that can be made with the ingredients in the fridge: {recipes}')

# Choose a random recipe from the list
recipe = random.choice(recipes)

# Print the chosen recipe
print(f'Recipe chosen: {recipe[0]}')

# Query the database for similar recipes
query = f'SELECT recipe FROM recipe_book WHERE ingredients LIKE "%{recipe[0]}%"'
cursor.execute(query)
# Fetch the results of the query
similar_recipes = cursor.fetchall()

# Print the list of similar recipes
print(f'Similar recipes: {similar_recipes}')

# Close the cursor and database connection
cursor.close()
db.close()

""" This script connects to a MySQL database and uses SQL queries to retrieve the ingredients in the fridge and the corresponding recipes from the fridge and recipe_book tables. It then uses a loop to find all the recipes that can be made with the ingredients in the fridge, and chooses a random recipe from the list using the random.choice() function. The script then recommends similar recipes to the user by querying the database for recipes that include the chosen recipe in their ingredients list. Finally, it prints the list of similar recipes.
